# LED-Pair-PCB
Part of the model railway lighting project; this is a PCB design

This is a small connector board that is used to drive two LEDs - it takes a roughly 9v input (probably anywhere from 7-10v is fine) and drives two leds - note both leds need to be present for the circuit to be made. It has a signal input (which is -ve) to control if the LEDs are on or not, and a 5V pass through to connect on to the next board in a sequence of these boards.

The design is in EAGLE PCB design
